# Editing the .in Files

While *doxywizard* makes it easy to edit these files, be aware that - on saving - it regenerates
the files from scratch. In the process, it removes any additional comments.

**Primarily, this means that the copyright and licensing information will be stripped from the files.**

Should the files *Doxyfile.client.in* and/or *Doxyfile.modules.in* be missing their copyright or 
licensing information, the following notice applies regardless.
